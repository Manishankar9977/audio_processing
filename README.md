Audio Signal processing is a method where intensive algorithms, techniques are applied to audio signals. Audio signals are the representation of sound, which is in the form of digital and analog signals. Their frequencies range between 20 to 20,000 Hz, and this is the lower and upper limit of our ears. Analog signals occur in electrical signals, while digital signals occur in binary representations. This process encompasses removing unwanted noise and balancing the time-frequency ranges by converting digital and analog signals. It focuses on computational methods for altering the sounds. It removes or minimizes the overmodulation, echo, unwanted noise by applying various techniques into it.
